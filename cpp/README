= Keyczar C++ =

== Dependancies ==

- C++ compiler
- Python for running the build system
- OpenSSL (>= 0.9.8b)
- [Optional]: Zlib (for compression)
- [Optional]: Swig (Python binding)

=== Ubuntu/Debian ===

Packages g++ make libssl-dev zlib1-dev python python-dev swig

=== MacOSX Leopard ===

XCode > 3.1 and MacPorts with the following packages: zlib openssl swig


== Supported architectures and systems ==

Processors: x86, x86_64, ARM
Systems: Linux, MacOSX (with MacPorts), BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD)

Note: only Linux x86 has been tested extensively


== Local build ==

For a local build of Keyczar C++ on Linux run these commands:

 $ cd cpp/src && sh ./tools/swtoolkit/hammer.sh --mode=opt-linux --compat

- Replace opt-linux by opt-bsd or opt-mac depending on your system
- The Python binding is built automatically if swig is detected
- Libraries and executables are assembled under scons-out/opt-linux/


== Install ==

You need to log as root and execute these commands:

  $ cd cpp/src && sh ./tools/swtoolkit/hammer.sh --mode=opt-linux --compat install

/!\ Note: it is actually highly recommanded to use the compatibility (--compat)
mode. This mode provides full compatibility with previous versions and others
Keyczar implementations (Java, pure Python).

- Default prefix paths used are /usr/local/ and /usr/lib/python2.x/site-packages
  for Python stuffs. Use src/options.conf and read src/tools/installer.py for
  overriding these choices.
- Learn how to use this library by reading the tutorial (on the wiki page), the
  examples located under src/examples/ and the main headers
  src/keyczar/keyczar.h and src/keyczar/keyczar_tool/keyczar_tool.h


== Options ==

--mode=XX  -> where XX can be opt-linux, opt-mac, opt-bsd, dbg-linux, dbg-mac or
              dbg-bsd. 'opt' stands for optimized mode and 'dbg' for debug mode.
--compat   -> ensure compatibility with Keyczar 0.6b specifications (see below)
install    -> install the C++ library and optionally its Python binding
-jX        -> use X threads for compiling it
-c         -> clean up the build and/or remove installed files


== Current Limitations ==

- Does not work on Windows (should be relatively easy to port it using OpenSSL
  however it would require much more work to use MS CAPI instead).
- Build system needs to be improved.


== Compatibility ==

- When compiled with option --compat this implementation is expected to be
  fully compatible with Keyczar 0.6b (see detailed specifications at
  http://code.google.com/p/keyczar/w/).
- When compiled without this option this implementation uses differents
  cryptographic algorithms as defined into algorithms.txt. And further
  modifications could happen in the future.
