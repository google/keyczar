= C++ implementation =


== Dependancies ==

- OpenSSL: package libssl-dev (Debian/Ubuntu)
- Unicode icu: package libicu-dev
- [Optional packages]: python and swig


== Local build ==

Currently this implementation only works under Linux, install the required
packages and compile it:

 $ cd cpp/src && ./tools/swtoolkit/hammer.sh --mode=opt-linux

Libraries and executables are assembled under scons-out/opt-linux/.


== Install ==

Files will be installed under /usr/local/ and under /usr/lib/python2.x/site-packages

1- Log as root and execute these commands to install the C++ library:

  $ cd cpp/src && ./tools/swtoolkit/hammer.sh --mode=opt-linux install

For details on how to use this library, read the tutorial and the examples located
under src/examples/ and also consult the header files /usr/local/include/keyczar.


== Options ==

install    -> install the C++ library and/or the Python binding
-c         -> clean up the build and/or remove installed files
--swig     -> compile the Python binding (requires Swig to be installed)
--compat   -> ensure compatibility with Keyczar 0.6b specifications (see below)
-jX        -> compile on X threads
--mode=XX  -> where XX can be opt-linux or dbg-linux, dbg-linux enables debug
              mode and opt-linux stands for optimized-linux.


== Current limitations ==

- This implementation only works under Linux with OpenSSL. The components and
  tools used should be multi-plateform but it hasn't been tested and it would
  likely require a lot of work if another cryptography library had to be used.
- Poor install mechanism.


== Adherence to specifications ==

- When compiled with option --compat this implementation is entirely compatible
  with Keyczar 0.6b (see detailed specifications at
  http://code.google.com/p/keyczar/w/).
- When compiled without this option this implementation use cryptographic
  algorithms defined in algorithms.txt and use a new attribute
  'nextKeyVersionNumber' in order to keep the next key version number to assign
  to new key.
